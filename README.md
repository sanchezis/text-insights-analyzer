## Project Purpose

This is a sample project designed as a proof of concept for a potential full-scale implementation.

Its main goal is to evaluate the skills in:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Information Retrieval (IR)
- Generative AI
- and/or Semantic Search

## Assignment Overview

Need to find a publicly available dataset that contains textual data and use it to solve a real-world problem in one of the following areas: NLP, IR, Generative AI, or Semantic Search. The project can focus on tasks such as text classification, summarization, topic modeling, question answering, media/content recommendation, or semantic search.

Once the dataset is selected, you're expected to carry out a thorough analysis, build a working model, and extract actionable insights that provide clear value or direction.

## Dataset selection

Following the project guidelines, I will select a dataset that contains textual data for analysis. Given my background and experience in the telecommunications industry, I am considering using a dataset related to this domain, as it aligns best with my expertise.

[Telecom 200K conversations](https://huggingface.co/datasets/talkmap/telecom-conversation-corpus/resolve/main/telecom_200k.csv)

## Problem Statement

The dataset consists of transcripts from customer and expert interactions. A key **challenge lies** in accurately identifying the customer’s intent—or multiple intents—throughout the entire conversation flow.

Additionally, it's difficult to evaluate the outcome of these interactions: whether the expert successfully resolved the issue, ended the call **appropriately** with a closing statement, or if the conversation was **abruptly cut off**.

Other areas of interest include detecting high levels of customer dissatisfaction, recognizing negative language from either party, and identifying cases where the expert's handling may have contributed to unresolved issues—potentially indicating a need for additional coaching or training.

### This analysis aims to extract meaningful insights from the transcripts to help answer these questions and uncover patterns that could inform decision-making and process improvement
